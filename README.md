# Minimax TicTacToe

In this project, we utilized concepts about adversarial search, minimax algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning.

## Minimax Algorithm Implementation

Adversarial search is a concept on game theory where we create agents with strategic-thinking, enabling them to function in a competitive environment against players. The minimax algorithm is an algorithm that allows the program to select the best possible move against the player.  

## Alpha-beta Pruning Implementation

We can actually run the game without implementing pruning, but it will really slow the game. Without pruning the tree, the program would need to evaluate all possible combinations and moves every step. Though it won't change how optimally it plays the game, the program would be able to run efficiently.
